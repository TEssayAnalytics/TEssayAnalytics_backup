		<li><h3><a href="{{ site.pages_dir }}/essay">Essay Writing</a></h3></li>
		<p>By using the essay scoring system
			(<b><i><a href="{{ site.website }}/PnF_nlp/">Score My Essay</a></i></b>)
			combined with our professional writing experience, we can provide more
			scientific and professional essay writing guidance to undergraduate and
			graduate applicants. <b><i><a href="{{ site.website }}/PnF_nlp/">Score My Essay</a></i></b>
			was developed by our team of researchers using natural language processing to

			admitted to top schools. Compared to traditional ways of writing, this system
			allows us to help undergraduate and graduate applicants improve the objective
			quality of their admissions essays.</p>

		<p>If you choose to DIY your own essay, you can still use
