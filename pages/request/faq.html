</div><!-- /.blurb -->

<div class="container">
	<p><b>1. What happens after I request a service by contacting you through
		email?</b></p>
	<p><ul class="posts">
		<li>Based on your email, we will evaluate whether and how we can help you
			with your application.</li>
		<li>If we can help you with your needs, we will invite you to a voice-call interview
			on Ding Talk (usually 10-15 minutes).</li>
		<li>During the interview, you will get to know more about our services, and
			we will learn more about your needs.</li>
		<li>You decide on the purchase.</li>
		<li>Once the contract is signed and the payment is completed, we will start the
			service(s).</li>

		</ul>
	</p>

	<p><b>2. How soon will I get your response?</b></p>
	<p>Usually you will hear back from us within <i>24 hours</i> on workdays.</p>

	<p><b>3. Why do I need to send you my applicant information to
		request a service?</b></p>
	<p>The information you fill out in the request-a-service email will help us
		better understand your background and needs. This will allow us to help you
		more efficiently. Your information will only be used by us to further provide you service(s),
		and will not be shared with any third party. Please see our
		<a href="{{ site.pages_dir }}/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

	<p><b>4. Do I need to answer every question in the request-a-service email?</b></p>
	<p>We strongly suggest you fill out as much information as possible. If some
		of the information is unavailable (e.g. standard scores), you can answer
		<i>N/A</i>. However, if too much information is missing, we may not be able to
		understand your needs or provide any service to you.</p>

	<p><b>5. If I donâ€™t want to send you a request-a-service email, can I talk to
		you directly through WeChat texts/voice calls?</b></p>

	<p>The request-a-service email is a necessary part of our initial pre-purchase
		customer service. We require it of all potential customers and will not
		proceed to communication through WeChat, or any other medium, until the
		initial pre-purchase process is complete.</p>

	<p><b>6. Can I ask you for any guidance on my application before I make a purchase?</b></p>

	<p>The pre-purchase consulting is mainly for you to learn more about our services, and for us to
		know more about your needs. Any application related questions can be answered after
		you purchase the corresponding  <a href="{{ site.pages_dir }}/services">services</a>.</p>

	<p><b>7. Can I ask you questions that are outside the scope of the service I have purchased?</b></p>

	<p>Questions <u>beyond the scope</u> of the service you have purchased can only be answered
			after you have purchased the corresponding <a href="{{ site.pages_dir }}/services">service(s)</a>.</p>
