<h2>TEssay Analytics Terms of Service</h2>
<p>Last modified: January 1, 2023</p>
<h3>Welcome to TEssay Analytics</h3>
<p>Thanks for using our products, blog and services (“Services”). The Services are
  provided by TEssay Analytics. By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms.
  You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
  Please read them carefully.</p>
<h3>Who May Use the Services</h3>
<p>You may use the Services only if you agree to form a binding contract with
  TEssay Analytics and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of
  the applicable jurisdiction. In any case, you must be at least 13 years old
  to use the Services. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services
  on behalf of another person, a company, organization, government, or other
  legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.</p>
<h3>Using our Services</h3>
<p>Do not misuse our Services. For example, do not interfere with our Services or
  try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions
  that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including
  applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend
  or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or
  policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>
<p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
  rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from
  our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise
  permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding
  or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal
  notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>
<p>Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services
  in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety
  laws.</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>TEssay Analytics’ <a href="{{ site.pages_dir }}/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
  explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use
  our Services. By using our Services, you agree that TEssay Analytics can use such data
  in accordance with our privacy policies.</p>
<h3>Information on the Services</h3>
<p>You are responsible for your use of the Services and for any Information you
  provide, including compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
  You should only provide Information that you are comfortable to include in
  your applications.</p>
<h3>Modifying and Terminating our Services</h3>
<p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove
  functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.</p>
<p>You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see
  you go. TEssay Analytics may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new
  limits to our Services at any time.</p>
<p>We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data
  is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will
  give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that
  Service.</p>
<h3>Liability for our Services</h3>
<p>When permitted by law, TEssay Analytics will not be responsible for lost profits,
  revenues, or data, financial losses, college or graduate-school admission
  failuresd or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of TEssay Analytics, for any claims
  under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the
  amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you
  the Services again).</p>
<p>In all cases, TEssay Analytics will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not
  reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p>We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a
  consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing
  in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal rights which
  may not be waived by contract.</p>
<h2>About these Terms</h2>
<p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to,
  for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should
  look at the terms regularly. Changes will not apply retroactively and will
  become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However,
  changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal
  reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified
  terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
<p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the
  additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>
<p>These terms control the relationship between TEssay Analytics and you. They do not
  create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we do not take action right away,
  this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as
  taking action in the future).</p>
<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not
  affect any other terms.</p>
