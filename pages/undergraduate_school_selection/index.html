	<p>In the Undergraduate School Selection <i>(aka USS)</i>
		service, based on our own custom <b><i>Application ROI</i></b> index, we can
		help you understand which of the TOP 50 universities are actually better
		investments (and in some cases which are relatively worse) for your college
		application. This one index used together with ranking,
    tuition, or admission rate data, directly shows not only the big picture of
    all the schools systematically, but also the relative investment advantage
    and/or disadvantage of each school.</p>

  <h3>How does the USS service work?</h3>
  <p>USS service is provided to you in the form of a report. Upon purchasing
    the USS service, you will receive a report that contains the Application
    ROI and college admissions data, data visualization and analysis of the school
    tier you select. We divide the TOP 50 universities into 5 tiers based on ranking,
    and <u>each report contains the data analysis of one tier</u>:</p>
  <ul class="posts">
      <li>Tier 1 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 1-10</li>
      <li>Tier 2 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 11-20</li>
      <li>Tier 3 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 21-30</li>
      <li>Tier 4 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 31-40</li>
      <li>Tier 5 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 41-50</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Price: 1615 Yuan (or 230 USD) per report</b></p>

  <p><i>Note:</i></p>
  <ol class="posts">
      <li>The rankings are based on 2020 Best National University Rankings by
        <a href="usnews.com">US News</a>.</li>
      <li>Since there are schools tied in rankings, every tier may contain more
        or less than 10 schools.</li>
      <li>College admissions data are from the fall 2020 entering class. They are
        the latest and most complete
        admission data. </li>
