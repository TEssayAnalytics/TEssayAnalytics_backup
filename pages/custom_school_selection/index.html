  <p>Through <b>Custom School Selection</b> (aka <i>CSS</i>), we provide
    application strategies that are specifically designed for your major/program.</p>

	<h3>Who can use the CSS service?</h3>

	<p>While the <a href="{{ site.pages_dir }}/undergraduate_school_selection">Undergraduate</a> and
		<a href="{{ site.pages_dir }}/dvm_school_selection">DVM School Selection</a> services are
		developed only for applicants of these two types of programs, CSS provides
		<u><i>objective guidance</i></u> on school selection to <u>applicants
		of other majors/programs</u>, such as Master in Data Science, Finance or
		Business Analytics.</p>

  <h3>How does the CSS service work?</h3>
  <p>CSS service is provided to you in the form of a report and personal consulting:</p>
    <ul class="posts">
        <li>Upon purchasing the CSS service, you will be asked to provide
          relevant personal information and major/program/school interests. </li>
        <li>After receiving your information, we will produce a report that
          contains schools we recommend and suggestions on how to
          prepare/improve your application. Additionally, the report shows you how the
          schools are selected <u>quantitatively</u> by presenting the raw data
          (admissions, programs, etc.), data visualization, and analysis of all the
          available schools. </li>
        <li>In the end, through the personal consulting, we will answer your
          questions and help you make the final decision on which schools to apply to.</li>
        <li>The whole service lasts 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
    </ul>

  <p><b>Price:</b> will be determined on a project-by-project basis.</p>
