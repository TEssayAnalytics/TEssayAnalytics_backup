	<p><b>1. What types of problems require the project-based consulting service?
  </b></p>
	<p>To solve your problem(s), if it requires <u>a continuous period of time</u>, you will need
    a project-based consulting service. For example:</p>
  <ul class="posts">
    <li>You need objective recommendations on which schools to apply</li>
    <li>You need guidance throughout the preparation of various documents</li>
    <li>You need guidance when you fill out and submit the application form</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>2. What kind of questions can I ask in the email-based
    consulting service?</b></p>
  <p>The questions need to be <u>very specific</u>. One question can be about one kind
    of document, or factor (e.g. GPA and activities). For example, you can ask:</p>
  <ul class="posts">
    <li>The GPA of my freshman year is very low, is there a way to make it look better?</li>
    <li>My professor may not be able to submit the recommendation letter in time, what should I do?</li>
    <li>Should I upload the transcript of the community college I attended last summer?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following questions can <b>only</b> be answered through the <u>project-based
    consulting</u>:</p>
  <ul class="posts">
    <li>Which school I should choose among these ten schools?</li>
    <li>Can you help me check my application form and see if there are any errors?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>3. Why do I need this service?</b></p>
	<p>While there can be many reasons, it's often because you need
    objective recommendations based on data-driven research and analysis, and
		professional guidance on preparing your application.</p>
