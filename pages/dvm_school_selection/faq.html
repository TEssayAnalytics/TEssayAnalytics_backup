	<p><b>1. Where do you get your data from?</b></p>
	<p>We harvest data from various public sources.</p>

	<p><b>2. How do you calculate your analytics?</b></p>
	<p>We have a small group of data scientists who do the necessary data munging,
    visualizing, machine learning, mathematics, software development, etc …</p>

	<p><b>3. Why should I purchase this service?</b></p>
	<p>Because you’re very clear about the value of <b>investing</b> in your
    academic career, and you want <b>every <i> advantage</i> possible</b> to help
    you successfully navigate the admissions process.</p>

	<p><b>4. What programming languages do you use for your analytics?</b></p>
	<p>We primarily use <b>Python</b> for all the <i>data science</i> work and
    <b>Docker</b> for any kind of deployment (i.e. training/deploying <b>machine learning</b>
    models, scientific computing with JupyterLab, etc …). </p>

	<p><b>5. How will this service help me?</b></p>
	<p>It will offer you a more <b>quantitative</b> and therefore <b>objective</b> picture of the
    different schools. By using  this service, you will be able to leverage
		your advantages (e.g. high GPA and rich veterinary experience) and
		find schools with <i>higher values</i>: <u>relatively high rankings, high admission
		rates, more educational & research resources, low tuitions, etc</u>.
	</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, the suggestions on how to prepare your application will guide
		you to systematically improve your profile within a limited time period. </p>


  <p><b>6. What guarantee do I have?</b></p>
  <p>We can only crunch the numbers and conduct the research. Ultimately what you do with it will determine
      how useful it can be.</p>
