<p>We are excited to announce a new family of TEssay Analytics services:
  <b>Strategic School Selection</b> (aka <i>Triple S</i>)!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>


<p>These new analytics services leverage the power of <u><i>data science</i></u> 
  in <u><i>Python</i></u> and <u><i>undergraduate/graduate admissions data</i></u> 
  to help customers develop the <b><i>objectively</i></b> best <u>application strategy</u>: what
  schools to apply to, and what application factors to improve.</p>

<p>For many people, college or graduate school is one of the most important
  investments they will make in their life. This one decision, this investment
  can forever alter the course of your life. During the last 4 years at 
  <b><i>TEssay Analytics</i></b> working diligently and passionately with our
  customers as they navigate the application process, we found that the
  consulting industry for college or graduate school application is strongly
  lacking something crucial: a rigorous application strategy. Inspired by our
  previous experience with and love of mathematics, data science, programming,
  and general computer science, we decided to create a family of services to
  provide students with the evidence they need to make the objectively best
  decisions regarding their school selection.</p>

<p>After almost a year of hard work, we proudly announce the following
  <b><i>Triple S</i></b> services:</p>
